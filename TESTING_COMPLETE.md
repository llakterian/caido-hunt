## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The 403 Handling Problem
**Before:**
- Scanner ignored 403 responses
- 0 endpoints discovered on blocked sites
- 0 tests performed
- 6 second "do nothing" scans

**After:**
- 403 responses treated as valid endpoints
- 10+ endpoints discovered on blocked sites
- 30+ parameter tests performed
- Comprehensive testing even with restrictions

### Performance Optimizations
- Reduced endpoint list: 29 → 10 most critical
- Reduced payloads: 11 → 6 per vulnerability type
- Faster delay: 0.1s → 0.05s between requests
- Scan time: 10-120 seconds depending on site
